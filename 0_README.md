# MiBu66 advent-of-code-2024
solutions via VBA

see https://adventofcode.com/2024 for the challenges

The code is mainly straight forward, trying to solve the challenge. 

You can use the code with VBA in Excel, you always have to use the "Basis" module, it contains the reader of the data. To automize the reading the challenge files have to be copied in the directory where your Excel-file lies. The naming is "dayXX.txt" for the complete challenge and "dayXX_Test.txt" for the small data shown in the text (XX=01-25).

Each module contains the software for one day. "AdventDayXXa" is part1, "AdventDayXXb" is part2. For some challenges additional functions are necessary which are stored in the "day module".
